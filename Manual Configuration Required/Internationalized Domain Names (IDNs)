What is it: Domain names can use international characters that look like other English characters. Used commonly on phishing 
  sites to further trick a user into thinking they are on a legimate site. Displaying all domains in their "punycode" equivalents
  however prevents this entirely.

Browsers that show punycode by default:
Chrome
Safari
Internet Explorer
Edge

Mozilla Firefox:
1) Navigate to "about:config"
2) Set "network.IDN_show_punycode" to "true"

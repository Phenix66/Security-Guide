What is it: Allows a website to copy custom text/code to the clipboard when the user copies something else from the site. 
   Commonly used when the content being copied is intended to be pasted into a command window or text editor such as VIM 
   that would support commands/macros.

"But I already use a script blocker?"
Doesn't seem to make a difference in my experience. Pastejacking relys on "Clipboard events" that can run without Javascript 
  being enabled if it was placed in the CSS code. Please note, you SHOULD be running a script blocker, some pastejacking does 
  occur in Javascript and therefore would not be prevented via these methods.


Firefox:
-Navigate to about:config
-Set "dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled" to false

IE:
-Tested with IE 11.1066.14393.0 on Windows 10 and it inherently blocked the attempt. Way to go MS for actually getting something right!

Chrome:
-Requires extension, no known method of disabling clipboard events.
-Right-to-Copy extension allows you copy ONLY what is selected, but requires you to right-click -> Copy instead of using Ctrl+C shortcut
